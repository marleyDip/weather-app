      <!-- They bind a prop called modalActive to the value of the variable modalActive. -->
      <!--  So... why use v-bind (or :)?
      Because you're passing data (a variable) from a parent component to a child component. In this case:

      1. The parent has modalActive in its <script>

      2. You're telling the child (<BaseModal>) to receive that value as a prop -->

            <li>
              Track the city by clicking on the "+" icon in the top right. this
              will save the city to view at a later time on the home page.

            <p>
              If you no longer wish to tack a city, simply select the city
              within the home page. At the bottom of the page, there will be an
              option to delete the city.
